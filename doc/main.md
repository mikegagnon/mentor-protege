~2010-name
## 2010 rule title

The rule initially appeared in the Regulatory Agenda of Fall 2010 with the title "Small Business Jobs Act: Small Business Mentor-Protégé Programs."

~2013-name
## 2013 rule title

SBA carried the 2010 rule title until the Regulatory Agenda of Spring 2013 when the reference to the Jobs Act was taken out, and the title changed to "Small Business Mentor-Protégé Programs."

This change reflected the statutory amendments in section 1641 of NDAA 2013.

~proposed-name
## Proposed rule title

When the proposed rule 
was published, the title had been changed to: "Small Business Mentor Protégé Program; Small Business Size Regulations; Government Contracting Programs; 8(a) Business Development/ Small Disadvantaged Business Status Determinations; HUBZone Program; Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program; Rules of Procedure Governing Cases Before the Office of Hearings and Appeals."

~final-name
## Final rule title

In drafting the final rule, SBA concluded that the simpler current title ("Small Business Mentor Protégé Programs") is easier for the public to understand and would be consistent with the title that has been publicly reported in the Regulatory Agenda since 2013.
