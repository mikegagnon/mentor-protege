<h2>Continued</h2>
<p>The commenters expressed that they felt that the purposes of the HUBZone program would be appropriately served by allowing non-HUBZone firms to act as mentors and joint venture with protégé HUBZone firms because the HUBZone firm itself would be developed and would necessarily be required to hire additional HUBZone employees if it sought to remain eligible for future HUBZone contracts.</p>
</div>

<div id='ndaa-2013-details'>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>On January 2, 2013, the President signed into law the NDAA 2013, Public Law 112–239, 126 Stat. 1632.</p>
</div>

<div id='all-sb'>
<h2>Did not eliminate</h2>
<p>The intent was to propose two separate mentor-protégé programs, one for 8(a) BD Participants and one for all small businesses </p>
<p>8(a) Participants may choose to create a small business mentor-protégé relationship instead of a mentor-protégé relationship under the 8(a) BD program.</p>
</div>

<div id='four'>
<h2>Four</h2>
<ol>
<li>One for small businesses</li>
<li>One for SDVO small businesses</li>
<li>One for WOSBs</li>
<li>One for HUBZone small businesses</li>
</ol>
<p>SBA made the decision to create one program since the other three types of small businesses (SDVO, HUBZone and women-owned) would be necessarily included within any mentor-protégé program targeting all small business concerns.</p>
</div>

<div id='cancel-mpa'>
<h2>Cancel a MPA</h2>
<p>SBA’s analysis as to whether a protégé  firm is adequately benefiting from the relationship or whether non-compliance with one or more specific terms or conditions of the MPA should warrant termination of the agreement is a fact specific determination to be made based on the totality of the circumstances. SBA would not terminate a particular MPA where there are de minimus or inadvertent violations of the agreement.
In addition, it is not SBA’s intent to terminate a particular MPA without considering the views of the protégé firm. However, the mere fact that a protégé wants the mentor-protégé relationship to continue will not be dispositive if SBA believes that termination is justified.</p>
</div>

<div id='clarification'>
<h2>Clarification</h2>
<p>The rule also amends the current joint venture provisions to clarify the conditions for creating and operating joint venture partnerships, including the effect of such partnerships on any mentor-protégé relationships.</p>
</div>

<div id='may-not-be-populated'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>This is a change from the current regulation.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#may-not-be-populated','#regulation-change-joint','1')">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>SBA explained that it is concerned that allowing populated joint ventures between a mentor and protégé would not ensure that the protégé firm and its employees benefit by developing new expertise, experience, and past performance. The separate joint venture entity would gain those things.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#may-not-be-populated','#gain-those-things','2')">2</a></sup> </p>
</div>

<div id='title'>
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>Finally, SBA notes that the title of this rule has been changed.</p>
</div>

<div id='both-opposed-competitive'>
<h2>Competitive</h2>
<p>They argued that this method of business organization facilitates the development of the disadvantaged small business because it makes the company more competitive in the marketplace. Specifically, these commenters pointed out that a populated joint venture has its own lower indirect costs, which, in turn, lowers the cost to the Government.</p>

<div id='place-comments'>
<h2>Note 3</h2>
<p>The commenters supported clarification of the current authority. The regulatory text merely highlights contracting officers’ discretionary authority to use these programs where appropriate regardless of the place of performance.</p>
</div>

<div id='gain-those-things'>
<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>If the individuals hired by the joint venture to perform the work under the contract did not come from the protégé firm, there is no guarantee that they would ultimately end up working for the protégé firm after the contract is completed.</p>
<p>In such a case, the protégé firm would have gained nothing out of that contract.</p>
<p>The company itself did not perform work under the contract and the individual employees who performed work did not at any point work for the protégé firm.</p>
</div>

<div id='inspect-comments'>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Several commenters requested SBA to clarify that the access should be limited to documents and records relating to the joint venture, not to unrelated documents of the joint venture partners themselves. SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#inspect-comments','#inspect-agree','agrees')">agrees</a>.</p>
<p>A few commenters also recommended that SBA should provide reasonable notice before it sought access to such records. SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#inspect-comments','#inspect-disagree','disagrees')">disagrees</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id='joint-obligations'>
<h2>Obligations</h2>
<p>For example, partners generally have fiduciary duties to each other, bind one another with their actions, and are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the business.</p>
</div>

<div id='8a-keep'>
<h2>Note 6</h2>
<p>The 8(a) BD program has independently operated successfully for a number of years and SBA believes that it serves important business development purposes that should continue to be coordinated through SBA’s Office of Business Development, rather than through a separate mentor-protégé office managed elsewhere within the Agency. As such, this final rule makes no changes as to how MPAs are processed for the 8(a) BD program.</p>
</div>

<div id='hub-commenters'>
<h2>Commenters</h2>
<p>SBA received a significant number of comments on this provision. The commenters overwhelmingly supported allowing a HUBZone qualified SBC that obtained an SBA-approved small business mentor-protégé relationship to be able to joint venture with its mentor on all contracts for which the protégé individually qualified, including HUBZone contracts. The commenters felt that such a provision would allow protégés to perform contracts that they otherwise could not have obtained and truly provide them with expertise and past performance that would help them to individually perform additional contracts in the future.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#hub-commenters','#hub-commenters-2','Continue')">Continue</a></p>
</div>

<div id='formal-informal'>
<h2>Formal or informal</h2>
<p>The proposed rule amended § 121.103(h) to clarify that every joint venture, whether a separate legal entity or an &#8220;informal&#8221; arrangement that exists between two (or more) parties, must be in writing. SBA never meant that an informal joint venture arrangement could exist without a formal written document setting forth the responsibilities of all parties to the joint venture. SBA merely intended to recognize that a joint venture need not be established as a limited liability company or other formal separate legal entity.</p>
</div>

<div id='disagree-unique'>
<h2>Unique problems</h2>
<p>HUBZone’s unique requirements with regard to employees, principal office, and residency make maintaining HUBZone status while participating in populated joint ventures difficult. In determining whether an individual should be determined an employee, the HUBZone program utilizes the totality of the circumstances approach and oftentimes a firm will have some individuals not on its payroll considered an employee for HUBZone eligibility purposes. Populated joint ventures present a problem because it can be difficult for firms to determine whom should be counted as an employee at any given time.</p>
</div>

<div id='revisions'>
<h2>Note 7</h2>
<p>The final rule revises the joint venture provisions contained in § 125.15(b) (for SDVO SBCs, and which are now contained in § 125.18(b)), § 126.616 (for HUBZone SBCs), and § 127.506 (for WOSB and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) concerns) to more fully align those requirements to the requirements of the 8(a) BD program.</p>
<p>The rule also adds a new § 125.8 to specify requirements for joint ventures between small business protégé firms and their mentors. The rule also makes several additional changes to current size, 8(a) BD and HUBZone regulations that are needed to clarify certain provisions or correct interpretations of the regulations that were inconsistent with SBA’s intent.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments'>
<h2>Comment period</h2>
<p>The proposed rule called for a 60-day comment period,
then SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#extended-cp','extended')">extended</a> the comment period another 30 days.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a 90-day comment period, SBA also conducted a series of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#tribal','tribal consultations')">tribal consultations</a> pursuant to Executive Order 13175, Tribal Consultations.</p>
<p>In response to the 90-day comment period, SBA received 113 comments.</p>
<p>Most of the commenters commented on multiple proposed provisions. With the exception of comments that did not set forth any rationale or make suggestions, SBA discusses and responds fully to all <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#c113','113 comments')">113 comments</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id='definition-jv'>
<h2>Definition of Joint Venture</h2>
<p>SBA’s size regulations recognize that joint ventures may be <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#definition-jv','#formal-informal','formal or informal')">formal or informal</a>.</p>
<p>A few comments <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#definition-jv','#formal-informal-comments','opposed')">opposed</a> that provision of the proposed rule that identified informal joint ventures as partnerships.</p>
<p>SBA received comments on <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#definition-jv','#both-joint','both')">both</a> sides of this issue.</p>
<p>SBA received <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#definition-jv','#inspect-comments','comments')">comments</a> on its proposal to require joint venture partners to allow SBA’s authorized representatives, including representatives authorized by the SBA Inspector General, to access its files and inspect and copy records and documents when necessary.</p>
</div>

<div id='jv-certify'>
<h2>Certify</h2>
<p>The proposed rule required all partners to a joint venture agreement that perform a SDVO, HUBZone, WOSB, or small business set-aside contract to certify to the contracting officer and SBA prior to performing any such contract that they will perform the contract in compliance with the joint venture regulations and with the joint venture agreement. In addition, the parties to the joint venture are required to report to the contracting officer and to SBA how they are meeting or have met the applicable performance of work requirements for each SDVO, HUBZone, WOSB or small business set-aside contract they perform as a joint venture.</p>
</div>

<div id='reg'>
<p><a href="img/cover.png">
<img src="img/cover.png" width=100%>
</a></p>
</div>

<div id='jv-supporting'>
<h2>Supporting</h2>
<p>Other commenters supported the proposed approach as a reasonable way to ensure compliance. SBA believes that affirmative reporting by the joint venture parties to both the contracting officer and SBA will provide the necessary information to track the use and performance of joint ventures. SBA also believes that the certification and reporting requirements implemented in this rule will assist the Government in its ability to deter wrongdoing. Regular reporting and monitoring of the limitations on subcontracting requirements will allow all parties to know where the joint venture stands with respect to those requirements and what must be done to come into compliance in the future if the joint venture&#8217;s performance is below the required amount at any point in time. A contracting officer will be able to more closely oversee the performance of a contract where the reports show inadequate performance to date.</p>
</div>

<div id='supporting'>
<h2>Supporting</h2>
<p>These commenters believed that a small business mentor-protégé  program would enable firms that are not in the 8(a) BD program to receive critical business development assistance that would otherwise not be available to them. Many of these commenters expressed support for the opportunity to gain meaningful expertise that would help them to independently perform more complex and higher value contracts in the future.</p>
</div>

<div id='limits-1641'>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>Section 1641 provides that a Federal department or agency could not carry out its own agency specific mentor-protégé program for small businesses unless the head of the department or agency submitted a plan for such a program to SBA and received the SBA Administrator’s approval of the plan.</p>
<p>Finally, section 1641 requires the head of each Federal department or agency carrying out an agency-specific mentor-protégé program to report annually to SBA the participants in its mentor-protégé program, the assistance provided to small businesses through the program, and the progress of protégé firms to compete for Federal prime contracts and subcontracts.</p>
</div>

<div id='ba'>
<h2>Business assistance</h2>
<p>This assistance may include, among other things, technical and/or management assistance; financial assistance in the form of equity investments and/or loans; subcontracts; and/or assistance in performing Federal prime contracts through joint venture arrangements.</p>
</div>

<div id='hub-purpose'>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The HUBZone program is a community growth and development program in which businesses are incentivized to establish principal office locations in, and employ individuals from, areas of chronically high unemployment and/or low income in order to stimulate economic development.</p>
</div>

<div id='8a'>
<h2>8a</h2>
</div>

<div id='contract-aff'>
<h2>Contractual affiliation</h2>
<p>SBA does not agree that this recommended change would be beneficial, for two
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It could create <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#contract-aff','#confusion-contract','confusion')">confusion</a></li>
<li>It could muddy <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#contract-aff','#unwanted-partner','partnership status')">partnership status</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, this final rule adopts the proposed language and specifies that a joint venture may be a formal or informal partnership or exist as a separate limited liability company or other separate legal entity. However, regardless of form, the joint venture must be reduced to a written agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, the proposed rule specified that if a joint venture exists as a formal separate legal entity, it may <em>not</em> be populated with individuals intended to perform contracts awarded to the joint venture.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#contract-aff','#may-not-be-populated','1')">1</a></sup></p>

</div>

<div id='1641'>
<h2>Section 1641</h2>
</div>

<div id='unwanted-partner'>
<h2>Partnership status</h2>
<p>SBA continues to believe that state law would recognize an &#8220;informal&#8221; joint venture with a written document setting forth the responsibilities of the joint venture partners as some sort of partnership.</p>
<p>As such, this rule merely identifies the consequences of forming an informal joint venture and should assist firms in determining what type of joint venture meets the parties’ needs in each case.</p>
<p>If the joint venture partners do not want the associated consequences of being considered a partnership, then it might be beneficial for the joint venture to be formed as a limited liability company.</p>

<p>SBA believes that the term &#8220;contractual affiliation&#8221; is not precise and would cause confusion.</p>
</div>

<div id='both-supported'>
<h2>Supported</h2>
<p>The supporters noted that forming a separate legal entity is an undue burden, and questioned whether the firm admitted to the 8(a) program (the protégé small business) would gain any direct benefits if all the work was performed by a separate legal entity.</p>
<p>In addition, several of the commenters appreciated SBA’s attempt to simplify these regulatory requirements.</p>
</div>

<div id='inspect-disagree'>
<h2>Disagrees</h2>
<p>SBA’s Office of Inspector General must be able to have unlimited access when investigating potential violations of SBA’s regulations. In a potential fraud case, providing notice could cause a destruction of records or provide time for a party to create the appearance of complying with applicable requirements. As such, this final rule does not require SBA to provide reasonable notice before seeking access to joint venture files, records and documents. SBA notes, however, that in its normal oversight responsibilities not related to any investigation of alleged wrongdoing, SBA would generally provide reasonable notice.</p>
</div>

<div id='misc'>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>In addition, the rule makes several additional changes to current size, 8(a) Office of Hearings and Appeals and HUBZone regulations, concerning among other things, ownership and control, changes in primary industry, standards of review and interested party status for some appeals.</p>
</div>

<div id='one'>
<h2>One new small business mentor-protégé program</h2>
<p>This rule implements a mentor-protégé program similar to the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program for all small business concerns.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#125-9','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA proposed one program for all small businesses,<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-easier','2')">2</a></sup> and requested comments on this proposal.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-comments','3')">3</a></sup> Most commenters supported this proposal.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-support','4')">4</a></sup> Many of the commenters were concerned, however, that changes could be made to the current 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#8a-change-concern','5')">5</a></sup></p>

<div id='purpose-8a'>
<h2>Purpose of 8(a) BD</h2>

<p>The explicit purpose of the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé relationship is to enhance the capabilities of protégés and to improve their ability to successfully compete for both government and commercial contracts.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mentor-protégé program for all small business concerns is designed to require approved mentors to provide <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#purpose-8a','#a','assistance')">assistance</a> to protégé firms.</p>

<p>The basis for GAO’s ruling was that SBA’s regulations were silent on this issue and therefore, the more specific FAR regulation controlled. Heeding this advice, SBA promulgated regulations to address this issue. Specifically, SBA made wholesale changes to 13 CFR 125.2 on October 2, 2013. As a result, SBA issued a final rule recognizing that small business contracting could be used &#8220;regardless of the place of performance.&#8221; 13 CFR 125.2(a) and (c).</p>

<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>Although SBA believes that the authority to use those programs in appropriate circumstances overseas already exists, the proposed rule merely sought to make that authority clear. Nothing in the Small Business Act would prohibit the use of those programs in appropriate circumstances overseas.</p>
</div>

<div id='final-name'>
<h2>Final rule title</h2>
<p>In drafting the final rule, SBA concluded that the simpler current title (&#8220;Small Business Mentor Protégé Programs&#8221;) is easier for the public to understand and would be consistent with the title that has been publicly reported in the Regulatory Agenda since 2013.</p>
</div>

<div id='sba-disagree'>
<h2>SBA disagreed</h2>
<p>In the current 8(a) BD mentor-protégé  program, in order for any mentor-protégé  relationship to continue, the 8(a) protégé  firm must demonstrate annually what benefits it has derived from the mentor-protégé  relationship. Where the benefits provided to the protégé  firm are minimal or where it appears that the relationship has been used primarily to permit a non–8(a) (oftentimes, large) mentor to benefit from contracts with its approved protégé, through one or more joint ventures, that it would otherwise not be eligible for, SBA will terminate the mentor-protégé  relationship. The proposed rule also provided that SBA may terminate the mentor-protégé  agreement (MPA) where it determines that the parties are not complying with any term or condition of the MPA. This rule requires similar reporting of benefits for non–8(a) protégé  firms and similar consequences where the benefits provided to the protégé  firm do not adequately justify the mentor-protégé  relationship.</p>
</div>

<div id='opposed'>
<h2>Opposed</h2>
<p>The commenter believed that it has not been established that the 8(a) mentor-protégé  program is bestowing a substantial benefit on 8(a) Participants, and, therefore, SBA should perform additional research and analysis before expanding the program.</p>
</div>

<div id='disagree-promote'>
<h2>Promote</h2>
<p>SBA questions how that can be accomplished where the protégé itself performs no work on a particular joint venture contract, and the employees who do the work for the separate legal entity may or may not have any present or future connection to the protégé firm. In the 8(a) BD context, the purpose is to promote the business development of the firm that was admitted to the 8(a) BD program, the protégé firm, not a separate legal entity that is not itself a certified 8(a) Participant.</p>
</div>

<div id='regulation-change-joint'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>The current regulation allows a separate legal entity joint venture to be unpopulated, to be populated with administrative personnel only, or to be populated with its own separate employees that are intended to perform contracts awarded to the joint venture.</p>
</div>

<div id='proposed-name'>
<h2>Proposed rule title</h2>
<p>When the proposed rule 
was published, the title had been changed to: &#8220;Small Business Mentor Protégé Program; Small Business Size Regulations; Government Contracting Programs; 8(a) Business Development/ Small Disadvantaged Business Status Determinations; HUBZone Program; Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program; Rules of Procedure Governing Cases Before the Office of Hearings and Appeals.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Jobs Act was designed to protect the interests of small businesses and increase opportunities in the Federal marketplace.</p>
<p>See Public Law 111–240, 124 Stat. 2504</p>
</div>

<div id='both-opposed'>
<h2>Opposed</h2>
<p>Many of these commenters believed that populated joint venture companies are an important mechanism for an entity-owned firm to remain <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#both-opposed','#both-opposed-competitive','competitive')">competitive</a>.</p>
<p>SBA understands the competitive argument and holds that populated joint ventures are still <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#both-opposed','#competitive-disagree','undesirable')">undesirable</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id='benefits-id'>
<h2>Identify benefits</h2>
<p>SBA continues to believe that the benefits received by a protégé from a joint venture are more readily identifiable where the work done on behalf of the joint venture is performed by the protégé and the mentor separately. In such a case, it is much easier to determine that the protégé firm performed at least 40% of all work done by the joint venture, performed more than merely ministerial or administrative work, and otherwise gained experience that could be used to perform a future contract independently. Thus, this rule adopts the proposed language to allow a separate legal entity joint venture to have its own separate employees to perform administrative functions, but not to have its own separate employees to perform contracts awarded to the joint venture.</p>
</div>

<div id='one-program-support'>
<h2>Note 4</h2>
<p>Most commenters supported having one new small business mentor-protégé program instead of four new mentor-protégé programs (one for SDVO small businesses, one for HUBZone small businesses, one for WOSBs, and one for small businesses not falling into one of the other categories).</p>
<p>Commenters agreed that it would be less confusing to deal with one new program, rather than four new programs, and that it was not necessary to have four separate mentor-protégé programs since the three subcategories of small business are necessarily included within the overall category of small business.</p>
</div>

<div id='tribal'>
<h2>Tribal consultations</h2>
<p>SBA conducted three in-person tribal consultations (in Washington, DC on February 26, 2015, in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 21, 2015, and in Anchorage, Alaska on April 23, 2015) and two telephonic tribal consultations (one on April 7, 2015, and a Hawaii/Native Hawaiian Organization specific one on April 8, 2015).</p>

<div id='summary'>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In August 2016, a Small Business Administration (SBA) rule went into effect (&#8220;the rule&#8221;), establishing a mentor-protégé  program, consistent with SBA’s <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#summary','#8a','8(a) Business Development (BD) program')">8(a) Business Development (BD) program</a>.</p>
<p>The rule also made a few <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#summary','#other-changes','other changes')">other changes</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id='formal-informal-comments'>
<h2>Opposed</h2>
<p>The commenters believed that entering into a formal or informal partnership often comes with certain <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#formal-informal-comments','#joint-obligations','obligations')">obligations</a> that may not be intended under a joint venture.</p>
<p>One commenter recommended that SBA should replace the phrase &#8220;formal or informal partnership&#8221; with the words &#8220;<a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#formal-informal-comments','#contract-aff','contractual affiliation')">contractual affiliation</a>,&#8221; and SBA disagreed.</p>
</div>

<div id='hub-mentor'>
<h2>Mentors</h2>
<p>To further this purpose, the HUBZone program regulations permitted a joint venture only between a HUBZone SBC and another HUBZone SBC. In authorizing a mentor-protégé relationship for HUBZone qualified SBCs, the proposed rule provided language to allow joint ventures for HUBZone contracts between a HUBZone protégé firm and its mentor, regardless of whether the mentor was itself a HUBZone qualified SBC.</p>

<h2>Place of performance</h2>
<p>In the case of Latvian Connection General Trading and Construction LLC, B–408633, Sept. 18, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ 224, GAO ruled that § 19.000(b) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)limits the application of FAR part 19 (dealing with SBA’s small business programs) to acquisitions conducted in the United States (and its outlying areas).<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments-place','#place-limits','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The February 5, 2015 proposed rule proposed to add similar language to
§§ 124.501, 125.22(b), 126.600, and 127.500, thus specifically authorizing contracting in the 8(a) BD, SDVO, HUBZone and WOSB programs regardless of the place of performance, where appropriate.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments-place','#place-feb5','2')">2</a></sup></p>

<h2>80 FR 6618</h2>
<p>On February 5, 2015, SBA published in the Federal Register a comprehensive proposal to implement a new Government-wide mentor-protégé program for all small businesses, 80 FR 6618.</p>
<p>SBA decided to implement one new small business mentor-protégé program instead of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#80-fr','#four','four')">four</a> new mentor- protégé programs</p>
<p>SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#80-fr','#all-sb','did not eliminate')">did not eliminate</a> the 8(a) BD mentor- protégé program.</p>
<p>The small business mentor-protégé program was drafted to be as similar to the 8(a) mentor-protégé program as possible.</p>
</div>

<div id='do-not-enhance'>
<h2>Do not enhance</h2>
<p>Although SBA understands the benefit of using lower indirect costs from a populated joint venture, SBA continues to believe that a small protégé firm does not adequately enhance its expertise or ability to perform larger and more complex contracts on its own in the future when all the work through a joint venture is performed by a populated separate legal entity. </p>

<p>With the enactment of the Jobs Act, Congress recognized that mentor-protégé programs serve an important business development function for small business and authorized SBA to establish <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#sbja-2010','#disadvantaged','mentor-protégé programs')">mentor-protégé programs</a>, each modeled on SBA’s existing mentor-protégé program available to 8(a) Business Development (BD) Program Participants.</p>
