<h2>Continued</h2>
<p>The commenters expressed that they felt that the purposes of the HUBZone program would be appropriately served by allowing non-HUBZone firms to act as mentors and joint venture with protégé HUBZone firms because the HUBZone firm itself would be developed and would necessarily be required to hire additional HUBZone employees if it sought to remain eligible for future HUBZone contracts.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>On January 2, 2013, the President signed into law the NDAA 2013, Public Law 112–239, 126 Stat. 1632.</p>
</div>

<div id='all-sb'>
<h2>Did not eliminate</h2>
<p>The intent was to propose two separate mentor-protégé programs, one for 8(a) BD Participants and one for all small businesses </p>
<p>8(a) Participants may choose to create a small business mentor-protégé relationship instead of a mentor-protégé relationship under the 8(a) BD program.</p>
</div>

<div id='four'>
<h2>Four</h2>
<ol>
<li>One for small businesses</li>
<li>One for SDVO small businesses</li>
<li>One for WOSBs</li>
<li>One for HUBZone small businesses</li>
</ol>
<p>SBA made the decision to create one program since the other three types of small businesses (SDVO, HUBZone and women-owned) would be necessarily included within any mentor-protégé program targeting all small business concerns.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<div id='comments-mentor-drop'>
<h2>Dropped</h2>
<p>SBA agrees that the &#8220;good financial condition&#8221; requirement has caused some confusion. SBA believes that the key issue is whether a proposed mentor can meet its obligations under its MPA. If a proposed mentor can fulfill those obligations and has the financial wherewithal to provide all of the business development assistance to the protégé firm as described in its MPA, SBA should not otherwise care about the proposed mentor’s financial condition. SBA wants to ensure that the protégé firm receives needed business development assistance through the mentor-protégé relationship. If that can be demonstrated, SBA will be satisfied with the arrangement. As such, this final rule changes the requirement that a mentor have good financial condition to one requiring that the mentor must demonstrate that it can fulfill its obligations under the MPA.</p>
</div>

<div id='cancel-mpa'>
<h2>Cancel an MPA</h2>
<p>One commenter requested clarification as to when and how SBA would cancel a MPA.</p>
<p>SBA’s analysis as to whether a protégé  firm is adequately benefiting from the relationship or whether non-compliance with one or more specific terms or conditions of the MPA should warrant termination of the agreement is a fact specific determination to be made based on the totality of the circumstances. SBA would not terminate a particular MPA where there are de minimus or inadvertent violations of the agreement.
In addition, it is not SBA’s intent to terminate a particular MPA without considering the views of the protégé firm. However, the mere fact that a protégé wants the mentor-protégé relationship to continue will not be dispositive if SBA believes that termination is justified.</p>
</div>

<div id='clarification'>
<h2>Clarification</h2>
<p>The rule also amends the current joint venture provisions to clarify the conditions for creating and operating joint venture partnerships, including the effect of such partnerships on any mentor-protégé relationships.</p>
</div>

<div id='may-not-be-populated'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>This is a change from the current regulation.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#may-not-be-populated','#regulation-change-joint','1')">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>SBA explained that it is concerned that allowing populated joint ventures between a mentor and protégé would not ensure that the protégé firm and its employees benefit by developing new expertise, experience, and past performance. The separate joint venture entity would gain those things.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#may-not-be-populated','#gain-those-things','2')">2</a></sup> </p>
</div>

<div id='comments-mentor-disagree'>
<h2>Disagreed</h2>
<p>The commenters argued that the statutory authorities were discretionary and did not require SBA to implement additional small business mentor-protégé programs. A few of these commenters also felt that if there were such a program, the mentors should be limited to other small businesses. They expressed the view that individual small businesses could be harmed competing against joint ventures in which a large business mentor was a partner.</p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-eligibility-response-1'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>As such, SBA does not agree with the commenters who recommended that SBA continue to limit protégés in the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program only to Participants whose size was less than half the size standard corresponding to their primary industry. Moreover, SBA feels that any small business could gain valuable business development assistance through the mentor-protégé program.</p>
</div>

<div id='one-program-support'>
<h2>Note 4</h2>
<p>Most commenters supported having one new small business mentor-protégé program instead of four new mentor-protégé programs (one for SDVO small businesses, one for HUBZone small businesses, one for WOSBs, and one for small businesses not falling into one of the other categories).</p>
<p>Commenters agreed that it would be less confusing to deal with one new program, rather than four new programs, and that it was not necessary to have four separate mentor-protégé programs since the three subcategories of small business are necessarily included within the overall category of small business.</p>
</div>

<div id='app-comments-oppose'>
<h2>Concern</h2>
<p>The commenters were concerned, however, about the administrative burden the additional small business mentor-protégé program will have on SBA’s resources. They felt that the volume of firms seeking mentor-protégé relationships could excessively delay SBA’s processing of applications. Commenters also opposed the proposal to have open enrollment periods to receive small business mentor-protégé applications. They thought that such a process would cause significant delays in allowing firms to benefit from the mentor-protégé program. They also felt that open enrollment periods could cause firms to miss out on developmental procurement opportunities if they had to wait several months before they could apply to participate in the program. If there were open enrollment periods, then commenters believed that firms should be processed on a first come first served basis, and different types of small businesses should not be given priority or processed first over other types of small businesses.</p>
</div>

<div id='jv-opposing'>
<h2>Opposing</h2>
<p>One commenter suggested use of an honor system for the reporting. SBA did not view this as a viable alternative. Others believed that certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM) should be sufficient.</p>

<div id='app-coping'>
<h2>High application volume</h2>
<p>The supplementary information to the proposed rule provided that SBA may institute certain &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; periods for the receipt of mentor-protégé applications if the number of firms seeking SBA to approve their mentor-protégé relationships becomes unwieldy. In such a case, SBA would then accept mentor-protégé applications only in &#8220;open&#8221; periods.</p>
</div>

<div id='one-program-comments'>
<h2>Note 3</h2>
<p>SBA specifically requested comments as to whether SBA should finalize one small business mentor-protégé program, as proposed, or, rather, five separate mentor-protégé programs for the various small business entities.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-three-comment'>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>A few commenters believed that all SBA should care about is whether a mentor can adequately provide needed business development assistance to a proposed protégé. If they could, these commenters believed that a specific firm could be a mentor for more than three protégé firms. They argued that some of the best potential mentors could be large firms that were already mentoring other small businesses, and by limiting the number of protégé s that a mentor could have could deprive a particular firm of a mentor that could be an ideal partner.</p>
<p>Conversely, several other commenters agreed with SBA that allowing one firm to mentor an unlimited number of
protégé firms could allow a large business to unduly benefit from contracts that are intended to primarily benefit small business. One commenter believed that allowing three protégé at the same time for one mentor was too much, and recommended restricting it to two protégé firms at one time.</p>
</div>

<div id='nearly'>

<p>SBA may modify the program to the extent necessary, given the types of small business concerns to be included as protégé.</p>

<p>The commenters believed that entering into a formal or informal partnership often comes with certain <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#formal-informal-comments','#joint-obligations','obligations')">obligations</a> that may not be intended under a joint venture.</p>
<p>One commenter recommended that SBA should replace the phrase &#8220;formal or informal partnership&#8221; with the words &#8220;<a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#formal-informal-comments','#contract-aff','contractual affiliation')">contractual affiliation</a>,&#8221; and SBA disagreed.</p>
</div>

<div id='three-prot'>
<h2>Three protégé</h2>
<p>In addition, the proposed rule provided that a mentor participating in any SBA-approved mentor-protégé program would generally have no more than one protégé at a time. It also provided that SBA could authorize a concern to mentor more than one protégé at a time where it can demonstrate that the additional mentor-protégé relationship would not adversely affect the development of either protégé firm (e.g., the second firm may not be a competitor of the first firm). The rule also proposed, however, that no firm could be a mentor of more than three protégé s in the aggregate at one time under either of the mentor-protégé programs authorized by
§ 124.520 or § 125.9. A mentor could choose to have: Up to three protégé s in the 8(a) BD program; or up to three protégé s in the small business program; or one or more protégé s in one program and one or more in another program, but no more than three protégé s in the aggregate. </p>
</div>

<div id='place-comments'>
<h2>Note 3</h2>
<p>The commenters supported clarification of the current authority. The regulatory text merely highlights contracting officers’ discretionary authority to use these programs where appropriate regardless of the place of performance.</p>
</div>

<div id='gain-those-things'>
<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>If the individuals hired by the joint venture to perform the work under the contract did not come from the protégé firm, there is no guarantee that they would ultimately end up working for the protégé firm after the contract is completed.</p>
<p>In such a case, the protégé firm would have gained nothing out of that contract.</p>
<p>The company itself did not perform work under the contract and the individual employees who performed work did not at any point work for the protégé firm.</p>
</div>

<div id='inspect-comments'>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Several commenters requested SBA to clarify that the access should be limited to documents and records relating to the joint venture, not to unrelated documents of the joint venture partners themselves. SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#inspect-comments','#inspect-agree','agrees')">agrees</a>.</p>
<p>A few commenters also recommended that SBA should provide reasonable notice before it sought access to such records. SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#inspect-comments','#inspect-disagree','disagrees')">disagrees</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id='joint-obligations'>
<h2>Obligations</h2>
<p>For example, partners generally have fiduciary duties to each other, bind one another with their actions, and are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the business.</p>
</div>

<div id='tribal'>
<h2>Tribal consultations</h2>
<p>SBA conducted three in-person tribal consultations (in Washington, DC on February 26, 2015, in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 21, 2015, and in Anchorage, Alaska on April 23, 2015) and two telephonic tribal consultations (one on April 7, 2015, and a Hawaii/Native Hawaiian Organization specific one on April 8, 2015).</p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-eligibility-response'>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>SBA believes that consistency between the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program and the small business mentor-protégé program is critical, particularly where this final rule authorizes an 8(a) mentor-protégé relationship to transition to a small business mentor-protégé relationship when the 8(a) protégé graduates from or otherwise leaves the 8(a) BD program. </p>
<p>Therefore, SBA believes that it does not make sense to have different rules regarding who can qualify as a protégé for the two mentor-protégé programs.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-eligibility-response','#c-protege-eligibility-response-1','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For this reason, SBA agrees with the commenters who recommended that a firm that does not qualify as small for its primary NAICS code should be able to form a mentor-protégé relationship in a secondary NAICS code for which it does qualify as small.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-eligibility-response','#c-protege-eligibility-response-2','2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, the final rule provides that a concern must qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to its primary NAICS code or identify that it is seeking business development assistance with respect to a secondary NAICS code and qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to that NAICS code.</p>
</div>

<div id='formal-informal'>
<h2>Formal or informal</h2>
<p>The proposed rule amended § 121.103(h) to clarify that every joint venture, whether a separate legal entity or an &#8220;informal&#8221; arrangement that exists between two (or more) parties, must be in writing. SBA never meant that an informal joint venture arrangement could exist without a formal written document setting forth the responsibilities of all parties to the joint venture. SBA merely intended to recognize that a joint venture need not be established as a limited liability company or other formal separate legal entity.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-mentor-size'>
<h2>Any size</h2>
<p>Because the language of section 45(d)(1) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 657r(d)(1), specifies a mentor in the small business mentor-protégé program to be ‘‘a for-profit business concern of any size’’ and section 45(a)(2) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 657r(a)(2), requires the mentor-protégé program for small businesses to be ‘‘identical to the [8(a) BD] mentor-protégé program &#8230; as in effect on the date of enactment of this section &#8230;,’’ which authorized large business mentors, this final rule authorizes only other than small businesses that are organized for profit to be mentors. Specifically, the final rule authorizes any ‘‘concern,’’ regardless of size, to be
a mentor, and the term ‘‘concern’’ has historically been defined in SBA’s size regulations to mean a business entity organized for profit.</p>
</div>

<div id='summary'>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In August 2016, a Small Business Administration (SBA) rule went into effect (&#8220;the rule&#8221;), establishing a mentor-protégé  program, consistent with SBA’s <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#summary','#8a','8(a) Business Development (BD) program')">8(a) Business Development (BD) program</a>.</p>
<p>The rule also made a few <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#summary','#other-changes','other changes')">other changes</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id='ba'>
<h2>Business assistance</h2>
<p>This assistance may include, among other things, technical and/or management assistance; financial assistance in the form of equity investments and/or loans; subcontracts; and/or assistance in performing Federal prime contracts through joint venture arrangements.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments'>
<h2>Comment period</h2>
<p>The proposed rule called for a 60-day comment period,
then SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#extended-cp','extended')">extended</a> the comment period another 30 days.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a 90-day comment period, SBA also conducted a series of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#tribal','tribal consultations')">tribal consultations</a> pursuant to Executive Order 13175, Tribal Consultations.</p>
<p>In response to the 90-day comment period, SBA received 113 comments.</p>
<p>Most of the commenters commented on multiple proposed provisions. With the exception of comments that did not set forth any rationale or make suggestions, SBA discusses and responds fully to all <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#c113','113 comments')">113 comments</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id='definition-jv'>
<h2>Definition of Joint Venture</h2>
<p>SBA’s size regulations recognize that joint ventures may be <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#definition-jv','#formal-informal','formal or informal')">formal or informal</a>.</p>
<p>A few comments <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#definition-jv','#formal-informal-comments','opposed')">opposed</a> that provision of the proposed rule that identified informal joint ventures as partnerships.</p>
<p>SBA received comments on <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#definition-jv','#both-joint','both')">both</a> sides of this issue.</p>
<p>SBA received <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#definition-jv','#inspect-comments','comments')">comments</a> on its proposal to require joint venture partners to allow SBA’s authorized representatives, including representatives authorized by the SBA Inspector General, to access its files and inspect and copy records and documents when necessary.</p>
</div>

<div id='jv-certify'>
<h2>Certify</h2>
<p>The proposed rule required all partners to a joint venture agreement that perform a SDVO, HUBZone, WOSB, or small business set-aside contract to certify to the contracting officer and SBA prior to performing any such contract that they will perform the contract in compliance with the joint venture regulations and with the joint venture agreement. In addition, the parties to the joint venture are required to report to the contracting officer and to SBA how they are meeting or have met the applicable performance of work requirements for each SDVO, HUBZone, WOSB or small business set-aside contract they perform as a joint venture.</p>
</div>

<div id='one-program-easier'>
<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>SBA proposed one program for all small businesses, because SBA believed it would be easier for the small business and acquisition communities to use and understand.</p>
</div>

<div id='app-comments-quick'>
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>SBA believes that the efficiencies gained by having a dedicated staff for the small business mentor-protégé program will allow SBA to timely process applications for mentor-protégé status, and that the need for open and closed enrollment periods will be reduced. Of course, it is still possible that the number of applications could overwhelm the dedicated small business mentor-protégé unit. If that is the case, open enrollment periods could still be a possibility. Several commenters suggested that SBA may have an enormous volume of applications, and others suggested otherwise. SBA believes that additional information is needed before a decision to control the acceptance of applications is necessary. If the need arises, SBA will provide advance notice to allow potential applicants the opportunity to properly plan.</p>

<div id='jv-supporting'>
<h2>Supporting</h2>
<p>Other commenters supported the proposed approach as a reasonable way to ensure compliance. SBA believes that affirmative reporting by the joint venture parties to both the contracting officer and SBA will provide the necessary information to track the use and performance of joint ventures. SBA also believes that the certification and reporting requirements implemented in this rule will assist the Government in its ability to deter wrongdoing. Regular reporting and monitoring of the limitations on subcontracting requirements will allow all parties to know where the joint venture stands with respect to those requirements and what must be done to come into compliance in the future if the joint venture&#8217;s performance is below the required amount at any point in time. A contracting officer will be able to more closely oversee the performance of a contract where the reports show inadequate performance to date.</p>
</div>

<div id='supporting'>
<h2>Supporting</h2>
<p>SBA received a significant number of comments supporting a small business mentor-protégé  program.</p>
<p>These commenters believed that a small business mentor-protégé  program would enable firms that are not in the 8(a) BD program to receive critical business development assistance that would otherwise not be available to them. Many of these commenters expressed support for the opportunity to gain meaningful expertise that would help them to independently perform more complex and higher value contracts in the future.</p>
</div>

<div id='limits-1641'>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>Section 1641 provides that a Federal department or agency could not carry out its own agency specific mentor-protégé program for small businesses unless the head of the department or agency submitted a plan for such a program to SBA and received the SBA Administrator’s approval of the plan.</p>
<p>Finally, section 1641 requires the head of each Federal department or agency carrying out an agency-specific mentor-protégé program to report annually to SBA the participants in its mentor-protégé program, the assistance provided to small businesses through the program, and the progress of protégé firms to compete for Federal prime contracts and subcontracts.</p>
</div>

<div id='hub-commenters'>
<h2>Commenters</h2>
<p>SBA received a significant number of comments on this provision. The commenters overwhelmingly supported allowing a HUBZone qualified SBC that obtained an SBA-approved small business mentor-protégé relationship to be able to joint venture with its mentor on all contracts for which the protégé individually qualified, including HUBZone contracts. The commenters felt that such a provision would allow protégé to perform contracts that they otherwise could not have obtained and truly provide them with expertise and past performance that would help them to individually perform additional contracts in the future.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#hub-commenters','#hub-commenters-2','Continue')">Continue</a></p>
</div>

<div id='hub-purpose'>
<h2>Purpose</h2>

<h2>Contractual affiliation</h2>
<p>SBA does not agree that this recommended change would be beneficial, for two

<li>It could muddy <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#contract-aff','#unwanted-partner','partnership status')">partnership status</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, this final rule adopts the proposed language and specifies that a joint venture may be a formal or informal partnership or exist as a separate limited liability company or other separate legal entity. However, regardless of form, the joint venture must be reduced to a written agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, the proposed rule specified that if a joint venture exists as a formal separate legal entity, it may <em>not</em> be populated with individuals intended to perform contracts awarded to the joint venture.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#contract-aff','#may-not-be-populated','1')">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>Partnership status</h2>
<p>SBA continues to believe that state law would recognize an &#8220;informal&#8221; joint venture with a written document setting forth the responsibilities of the joint venture partners as some sort of partnership.</p>
<p>As such, this rule merely identifies the consequences of forming an informal joint venture and should assist firms in determining what type of joint venture meets the parties’ needs in each case.</p>
<p>If the joint venture partners do not want the associated consequences of being considered a partnership, then it might be beneficial for the joint venture to be formed as a limited liability company.</p>

<h2>Final rule</h2>
<p>As such, the final rule adopts the proposed language requiring joint venture partners to annually report compliance to both the contracting officer and SBA.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-three-response'>
<h2>SBA responded</h2>
<p>SBA continues to believe that there must be
a limit on the number of firms that one business, particularly one that is other than small, can mentor.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments-three-response','#comments-three-response-1','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the 8(a) BD program in effect at the time that the Jobs Act and the NDAA 2013, also limited mentors to having no more than three protégé firms.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments-three-response','#comments-three-response-2','2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the proposed rule provided that a protégé in the small business mentor-protégé program may not become a mentor and retain its protégé status. Commenters opposed, and SBA agreed with the opposition; thus, this final rule provides that SBA may authorize a small business to be both a protégé and a mentor at the same time where the firm can demonstrate that the second relationship will not compete or otherwise conflict with the first mentor-protégé relationship.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments-three-response','#comments-three-response-3','3')">3</a></sup></p>
</div>

<div id='inspect-agree'>
<h2>Agrees</h2>
<p>SBA has amended §§ 124.513(i), 125.8(h), 125.18(b)(8), 126.616(h), and 127.506(i) to clarify that SBA’s access would be related to files, records and documents of the joint venture.</p>

<h2>Confusion</h2>
<p>SBA believes that the term &#8220;contractual affiliation&#8221; is not precise and would cause confusion.</p>
</div>

<div id='both-supported'>
<h2>Supported</h2>
<p>The supporters noted that forming a separate legal entity is an undue burden, and questioned whether the firm admitted to the 8(a) program (the protégé small business) would gain any direct benefits if all the work was performed by a separate legal entity.</p>
<p>In addition, several of the commenters appreciated SBA’s attempt to simplify these regulatory requirements.</p>
</div>

<div id='expanding-comments'>
<h2>Expanding</h2>
<p>One commenter <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#expanding-comments','#opposed','opposed')">opposed</a> expanding the mentor-protégé  program beyond the 8(a) BD program, and <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#expanding-comments','#sba-disagree','SBA disagreed')">SBA disagreed</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-eligibility'>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>In order to qualify as a protégé, the proposed rule required a business concern to qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to its primary NAICS code.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-eligibility','#comments-proteges-1','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA received a significant number of comments supporting the change to loosen the requirements to qualify as a protégé for the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-eligibility','#comments-proteges-2','2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, a few commenters did not support changes to the size of the protégé for the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-eligibility','#comments-proteges-3','3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA also received several comments recommending that a firm should be able to form a mentor-protégé relationship as long as it qualified as small for the particular type of work for which a mentor-protégé relationship is sought, even if the firm no longer qualified as small for its primary business activity.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-eligibility','#comments-proteges-4','4')">4</a></sup></p>
</div>

<div id='inspect-disagree'>
<h2>Disagrees</h2>
<p>SBA’s Office of Inspector General must be able to have unlimited access when investigating potential violations of SBA’s regulations. In a potential fraud case, providing notice could cause a destruction of records or provide time for a party to create the appearance of complying with applicable requirements. As such, this final rule does not require SBA to provide reasonable notice before seeking access to joint venture files, records and documents. SBA notes, however, that in its normal oversight responsibilities not related to any investigation of alleged wrongdoing, SBA would generally provide reasonable notice.</p>
</div>

<div id='misc'>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>In addition, the rule makes several additional changes to current size, 8(a) Office of Hearings and Appeals and HUBZone regulations, concerning among other things, ownership and control, changes in primary industry, standards of review and interested party status for some appeals.</p>
</div>

<div id='one'>
<h2>One new small business mentor-protégé program</h2>
<p>Most commenters supported having one new small business mentor-protégé program instead of four new mentor-protégé programs.</p>
<p>This rule implements a mentor-protégé program similar to the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program for all small business concerns.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#125-9','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA proposed one program for all small businesses,<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-easier','2')">2</a></sup> and requested comments on this proposal.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-comments','3')">3</a></sup> Most commenters supported this proposal.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-support','4')">4</a></sup> Many of the commenters were concerned, however, that changes could be made to the current 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#8a-change-concern','5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA has considered those concerns and has decided to keep the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program as a separate program.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#8a-keep','6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the final rule revises several joint venture provisions.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#revisions','7')">7</a></sup></p>
</div>

<div id='purpose-8a'>
<h2>Purpose of 8(a) BD</h2>
<p>The mentor-protégé program available to firms participating in the 8(a) BD program is used as a business development tool in which mentors provide diverse types of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#purpose-8a','#ba','business assistance')">business assistance</a> to eligible 8(a) BD protégé.</p>
<p>The explicit purpose of the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé relationship is to enhance the capabilities of protégé and to improve their ability to successfully compete for both government and commercial contracts.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mentor-protégé program for all small business concerns is designed to require approved mentors to provide <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#purpose-8a','#a','assistance')">assistance</a> to protégé firms.</p>
</div>

<div id='possible-approaches'>
<h2>Various methods</h2>
<p>The possible approaches included: Requiring all joint ventures permitted by the regulations to include in their names &#8220;small business joint venture,&#8221; and, if a mentor-protégé joint venture, to include in their names &#8220;mentor-protégé small business joint venture;&#8221; requiring contracting officers to identify awards as going to small business joint ventures or to mentor-protégé small business joint ventures; requiring SBCs to amend their SAM entries to specify that they have formed a joint venture; requiring each joint venture to get a separate DUNS number; or a combination of all of these actions. SBA sought to ensure that governmental agencies and members of the public could track joint venture awards, which would promote transparency and accountability.</p>
</div>

<div id='final-name'>
<h2>Final rule title</h2>
<p>In drafting the final rule, SBA concluded that the simpler current title (&#8220;Small Business Mentor Protégé Programs&#8221;) is easier for the public to understand and would be consistent with the title that has been publicly reported in the Regulatory Agenda since 2013.</p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-transferring'>
<h2>Transferring</h2>
<p>The proposed rule provided that a protégé firm that graduates or otherwise leaves the 8(a) BD program but continues to qualify as a small business may transfer its 8(a) mentor-protégé relationship to a small business mentor-protégé relationship.</p>
<p>Several commenters supported this proposal as a natural extension of SBA’s implementation of a small business mentor-protégé program.</p>
<p>A few commenters sought clarification, however, as to whether the transfer from an 8(a) BD mentor-protégé relationship to a small business mentor-protégé relationship would be automatic or whether the protégé firm would have to apply and again receive SBA approval.</p>
<p>The final rule adopts the language of the proposed rule and adds clarifying language that a firm seeking to transfer its mentor-protégé relationship could do so by <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-transferring','#c-protege-notification','notification')">notification</a>, without applying to and receiving approval from SBA to do so.</p>
</div>

<div id='2010-name'>
<h2>2010 rule title</h2>
<p>The rule initially appeared in the Regulatory Agenda of Fall 2010 with the title &#8220;Small Business Jobs Act: Small Business Mentor-Protégé Programs.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-mentor-implement'>
<h2>Implement a mentor-protégé program</h2>
<p>Although SBA understands that the small business mentor-protégé programs authorized by the Jobs Act and the NDAA 2013 are discretionary, SBA believes that they will serve an important developmental function that will enable many small businesses to grow to be able to independently perform procurements that they otherwise would not have been able to perform. In addition, the vast majority of commenters supported a small business mentor-protégé program and many of those comments believed that it would be critical in helping them to advance and be able to perform larger and more complex contracts on their own. SBA agrees with the majority of commenters on this issue and this final rule implements a small business mentor-protégé program.</p>
</div>

<div id='2013-name'>
<h2>2013 rule title</h2>
<p>SBA carried the 2010 rule title until the Regulatory Agenda of Spring 2013 when the reference to the Jobs Act was taken out, and the title changed to &#8220;Small Business Mentor-Protégé Programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This change reflected the statutory amendments in section 1641 of NDAA 2013.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-three-response-1'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>Although SBA believes that the small business mentor-protégé program will certainly afford business development opportunities to many small businesses, SBA remains concerned about large businesses benefiting disproportionately.</p>
<p>If one firm could be a mentor for an unlimited number (or even a larger limited number) of protégé, that firm would receive benefits from the mentor-protégé program through joint ventures and possible stock ownership far beyond the benefits to be derived by any individual protégé.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-three-response-3'>
<h2>Note 3</h2>
<p>That proposal was patterned off the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program. SBA received several comments opposing this proposal. The commenters felt that firms that have themselves been protégé may be in the best position to act as mentors. In addition, they argued that just because a firm can act as a mentor to smaller or less experienced firms does not mean that they too don’t need help getting to the next level. They did not believe that it would make sense to require a current protégé to terminate the MPA with its mentor before it will be approved as a mentor to another small business concern. The commenters believed that in both the 8(a) BD and small business mentor-protégé programs a firm should be permitted to be both a protégé and mentor in appropriate circumstances. </p>
</div>

<div id='comments-three-response-2'>
<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>Since those authorities permitted SBA to implement a small business mentor-protégé program as similar as possible to the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program, it makes sense that SBA should limit any mentor to a total of three protégé firms. Therefore, this final rule adopts the language of the proposed rule, which permits any mentor to have up to a total of three protégé firms at one time. One commenter requested that SBA clarify that a mentor can have no more than three protégé firms at one time, not three firms in the mentor’s entire existence. SBA believes that is adequately spelled out in the regulatory text and does not further clarify that provision in this final rule.</p>
</div>

<div id='app-review'>
<h2>Application review</h2>
<p>The proposed rule provided that a small business seeking
a mentor-protégé relationship would be required to submit an application to SBA and that SBA’s Director of Government Contracting (D/GC) would review and either approve or decline small business MPAs.</p>
<p>SBA’s Associate Administrator for BD (AA/BD) would continue to review and approve or decline mentor-protégé relationships in the 8(a) BD program. Under the proposed language, an eligible 8(a) BD Program Participant could choose to seek SBA’s approval of a mentor-protégé relationship through the 8(a) BD program, or could seek a small business mentor-protégé relationship through SBA’s mentor-protégé program for all small businesses. SBA announced it was considering having one office review and either approve or decline all MPAs to ensure consistency in the process, and specifically sought comments as to whether that approach should be implemented.</p>
</div>

<div id='place-limits'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>The basis for GAO’s ruling was that SBA’s regulations were silent on this issue and therefore, the more specific FAR regulation controlled. Heeding this advice, SBA promulgated regulations to address this issue. Specifically, SBA made wholesale changes to 13 CFR 125.2 on October 2, 2013. As a result, SBA issued a final rule recognizing that small business contracting could be used &#8220;regardless of the place of performance.&#8221; 13 CFR 125.2(a) and (c).</p>

<p>Although SBA believes that the authority to use those programs in appropriate circumstances overseas already exists, the proposed rule merely sought to make that authority clear. Nothing in the Small Business Act would prohibit the use of those programs in appropriate circumstances overseas.</p>
</div>

<div id='ndaa-2013'>
<h2>NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013</h2>
<p>Section 1641 of NDAA 2013 authorized SBA to establish a mentor-protégé program for all small business concerns.</p>
<p>This section further provides that a small business mentor-protégé program must be <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#ndaa-2013','#nearly','nearly')">nearly</a> identical to the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program.</p>
<p>Section 1641 also <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#ndaa-2013','#limits-1641','limits')">limits</a> other agencies ability to create mentor-protégé programs.</p>
</div>

<div id='sba-disagree'>
<h2>SBA disagreed</h2>
<p>In the current 8(a) BD mentor-protégé  program, in order for any mentor-protégé  relationship to continue, the 8(a) protégé  firm must demonstrate annually what benefits it has derived from the mentor-protégé  relationship. Where the benefits provided to the protégé  firm are minimal or where it appears that the relationship has been used primarily to permit a non–8(a) (oftentimes, large) mentor to benefit from contracts with its approved protégé, through one or more joint ventures, that it would otherwise not be eligible for, SBA will terminate the mentor-protégé  relationship. The proposed rule also provided that SBA may terminate the mentor-protégé  agreement (MPA) where it determines that the parties are not complying with any term or condition of the MPA. This rule requires similar reporting of benefits for non–8(a) protégé  firms and similar consequences where the benefits provided to the protégé  firm do not adequately justify the mentor-protégé  relationship.</p>
</div>

<div id='track-oppose'>
<h2>Opposition</h2>
<p>Several commenters opposed the naming requirement, expressing concern about the administrative burden on the participating firms to change names, establish duns numbers and meet other compliance requirements in order to meet this requirement. Other commenters recommended that the cleanest way to track awards to joint ventures would in fact be to require a joint venture to form a new entity in SAM and identity itself to be a joint venture in SAM. Several commenters suggested the SAM system adopt a certification for joint ventures, or alternatively contracting officers designate in SAM that an award was made to a joint venture.</p>
</div>

<div id='opposed'>
<h2>Opposed</h2>
<p>The commenter believed that it has not been established that the 8(a) mentor-protégé  program is bestowing a substantial benefit on 8(a) Participants, and, therefore, SBA should perform additional research and analysis before expanding the program.</p>
</div>

<div id='disagree-promote'>
<h2>Promote</h2>
<p>SBA questions how that can be accomplished where the protégé itself performs no work on a particular joint venture contract, and the employees who do the work for the separate legal entity may or may not have any present or future connection to the protégé firm. In the 8(a) BD context, the purpose is to promote the business development of the firm that was admitted to the 8(a) BD program, the protégé firm, not a separate legal entity that is not itself a certified 8(a) Participant.</p>
</div>

<div id='regulation-change-joint'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>The current regulation allows a separate legal entity joint venture to be unpopulated, to be populated with administrative personnel only, or to be populated with its own separate employees that are intended to perform contracts awarded to the joint venture.</p>
</div>

<div id='proposed-name'>
<h2>Proposed rule title</h2>
<p>When the proposed rule 
was published, the title had been changed to: &#8220;Small Business Mentor Protégé Program; Small Business Size Regulations; Government Contracting Programs; 8(a) Business Development/ Small Disadvantaged Business Status Determinations; HUBZone Program; Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program; Rules of Procedure Governing Cases Before the Office of Hearings and Appeals.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-sam'>
<h2>SAM</h2>
<p>In response to the comments, SBA first notes that any SAM certification process is beyond SBA’s authority and outside the scope of this rule. SBA also notes that current participants in the 8(a) BD program annually report to SBA the joint venture awards they have received and how they are meeting the limitations on subcontracting requirements. To track small business joint venture awards, SBA could require similar reporting. However, SBA does not seek to impose any unnecessary burdens on small business. With that in mind, SBA believes that additional reporting is not necessary, but continues to believe that some sort of joint venture identification is required. Thus, this final rule requires joint ventures to be separately identified in SAM so that awards to joint ventures can be properly accounted for. A joint venture must be identified as a joint venture in SAM, with a separate DUNS number and CAGE number than those of the individual parties to the joint venture. In addition, the Entity Type in SAM must be identified as a joint venture, and the individual joint venture partners should also be listed.</p>
</div>

<div id='jv-tracking'>
<h2>Tracking joint venture awards</h2>
<p>The proposed rule announced that SBA was considering <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#jv-tracking','#possible-approaches','various methods')">various methods</a> of tracking awards to the joint ventures permitted by SBA’s regulations.</p>
<p>SBA specifically asked for comments on how best to track awards to joint ventures. SBA believes a tracking approach will deter fraudulent or improper conduct, and promote compliance with SBA’s regulations.</p>
<p>SBA received numerous comments on these proposals both in support and in <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#jv-tracking','#track-oppose','opposition')">opposition</a> to the alternate approaches contemplated.</p>

</div>

<div id='benefits-id'>
<h2>Identify benefits</h2>
<p>SBA continues to believe that the benefits received by a protégé from a joint venture are more readily identifiable where the work done on behalf of the joint venture is performed by the protégé and the mentor separately. In such a case, it is much easier to determine that the protégé firm performed at least 40% of all work done by the joint venture, performed more than merely ministerial or administrative work, and otherwise gained experience that could be used to perform a future contract independently. Thus, this rule adopts the proposed language to allow a separate legal entity joint venture to have its own separate employees to perform administrative functions, but not to have its own separate employees to perform contracts awarded to the joint venture.</p>
</div>

<div id='both-opposed-competitive'>
<h2>Competitive</h2>
<p>They argued that this method of business organization facilitates the development of the disadvantaged small business because it makes the company more competitive in the marketplace. Specifically, these commenters pointed out that a populated joint venture has its own lower indirect costs, which, in turn, lowers the cost to the Government.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-proteges-1'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>This was a departure for the current 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program, which required an 8(a) Program Participant to: Have a size that is less than half the size standard corresponding to its primary NAICS code; or be in the developmental stage of its 8(a) program participation; or not have received an 8(a) contract.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-mentor-elig'>
<h2>Mentor eligibility</h2>
<p>The proposed rule permitted any for-profit business concern that demonstrates a commitment and the ability to assist small business concerns to be approved to act as a mentor and receive the benefits of the mentor-protégé relationship. SBA also proposed to limit mentors to for-profit business entities based on the language contained in the NDAA 2013. Section 1641 of the NDAA 2013 added section 45(d)(1) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 657r(d)(1), which defines the term mentor to be &#8220;a for-profit business concern of any size.&#8221; In order to make the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program consistent with the small business mentor-protégé program, SBA proposed that mentors in the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program must be for profit businesses as well. This was a change for the 8(a) BD program, which previously allowed non-profit entities to be mentors. SBA felt that the change to the 8(a) BD program made sense because Congress intended the new mentor-protégé program for small businesses to be as similar to the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program as possible.</p>
</div>

<div id='8a-keep'>
<h2>Note 6</h2>
<p>The 8(a) BD program has independently operated successfully for a number of years and SBA believes that it serves important business development purposes that should continue to be coordinated through SBA’s Office of Business Development, rather than through a separate mentor-protégé office managed elsewhere within the Agency. As such, this final rule makes no changes as to how MPAs are processed for the 8(a) BD program.</p>

<h2>Place of performance</h2>
<p>In the case of Latvian Connection General Trading and Construction LLC, B–408633, Sept. 18, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ 224, GAO ruled that § 19.000(b) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)limits the application of FAR part 19 (dealing with SBA’s small business programs) to acquisitions conducted in the United States (and its outlying areas).<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments-place','#place-limits','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The February 5, 2015 proposed rule proposed to add similar language to
§§ 124.501, 125.22(b), 126.600, and 127.500, thus specifically authorizing contracting in the 8(a) BD, SDVO, HUBZone and WOSB programs regardless of the place of performance, where appropriate.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments-place','#place-feb5','2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA received a few comments on this issue.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments-place','#place-comments','3')">3</a></sup></p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-refrain-2'>
<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>These commenters did not believe that size and 8(a) BD status were comparable. They argued that size has always been a self-certification process that is open to review and protest in connection with any individual procurement, and that the same should be true in the mentor-protégé context. They felt that SBA should be able to rely on the size self-certification of a firm seeking to qualify as small for a small business mentor-protégé relationship. The commenters believed that a firm approved to be a small business protégé would not gain any undue benefit from the program merely by entering a mentor-protégé relationship. If a firm that was approved to be a protégé was not in fact small and was awarded a joint venture contract with its mentor based solely on its status as a protégé, of course that would be objectionable. However, because the size protest procedures permit any interested party to protest the size of any apparent successful offeror, the commenters believed that a protégé that was not small would ultimately be found ineligible for award of the contract and, thus, would not unduly benefit from its mentor-protégé relationship.</p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-refrain-1'>
<h2>Note 1</h2>
<p>SBA was attempting to make eligibility for the small business mentor-protégé program similar to that of the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program. Just as only firms that have been certified to be eligible to participate in the 8(a) BD program and verified to meet at least one of the three requirements set forth in the prior 8(a) BD regulations could be a protégé, the proposed rule would have permitted only those firms that have been affirmatively determined to be small to qualify as protégés for the small business mentor-protégé program.</p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-notification'>
<h2>Notification</h2>
<p>It was not SBA’s intent to require a firm to apply to transfer its 8(a) BD mentor-protégé relationship to a small business mentor-protégé relationship. SBA intended that a firm merely inform SBA of its intent to transfer its mentor-protégé relationship. There would be no SBA review or approval required of such a transfer.</p>
<p>In light of that change, the final rule also deletes § 124.520(d)(5) as unnecessary. That provision provided that SBA would not approve an 8(a) BD mentor-protégé relationship where the proposed protégé firm had less than six months remaining in its 8(a) program term. Because SBA will now permit an 8(a) protégé to transfer its mentor-protégé relationship to a small business mentor-protégé relationship after it leaves the 8(a) BD program (provided the firm continues to qualify as a small business), it does not make sense that SBA would not approve a mentor-protégé relationship for a proposed 8(a) protégé that has less than six months remaining in its program term. SBA will give such a firm the option of pursuing an 8(a) mentor-protégé relationship during its last six months in the 8(a) BD program, and then transferring that relationship to a small business mentor-protégé relationship when the protégé firm leaves the 8(a) BD program, or pursuing a small business mentor-protégé relationship during that same time frame.</p>
</div>

<div id='80-fr'>
<h2>80 FR 6618</h2>
<p>On February 5, 2015, SBA published in the Federal Register a comprehensive proposal to implement a new Government-wide mentor-protégé program for all small businesses, 80 FR 6618.</p>
<p>SBA decided to implement one new small business mentor-protégé program instead of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#80-fr','#four','four')">four</a> new mentor-protégé programs</p>
<p>SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#80-fr','#all-sb','did not eliminate')">did not eliminate</a> the 8(a) BD mentor-gprotégé program.</p>
<p>The small business mentor-protégé program was drafted to be as similar to the 8(a) mentor-protégé program as possible.</p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-refrain'>
<h2>Refrain</h2>
<p>§ 125.9(c)(1) of the proposed rule required that SBA verify that a firm qualifies as a small business before approving that firm to act as a protégé in a small business mentor-protégé relationship.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-refrain','#c-protege-refrain-1','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Several commenters believed that such a requirement was overly burdensome.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#c-protege-refrain','#c-protege-refrain-2','2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA agrees, and as long as it is clear that SBA’s approval of a mentor-protégé relationship does not amount to a formal determination of size eligibility, SBA believes that the size protest procedures would in fact be sufficient to protect the integrity of the program.</p>
</div>

<div id='do-not-enhance'>
<h2>Do not enhance</h2>
<p>Although SBA understands the benefit of using lower indirect costs from a populated joint venture, SBA continues to believe that a small protégé firm does not adequately enhance its expertise or ability to perform larger and more complex contracts on its own in the future when all the work through a joint venture is performed by a populated separate legal entity. </p>
</div>

<div id='revisions'>
<h2>Note 7</h2>
<p>The final rule revises the joint venture provisions contained in § 125.15(b) (for SDVO SBCs, and which are now contained in § 125.18(b)), § 126.616 (for HUBZone SBCs), and § 127.506 (for WOSB and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) concerns) to more fully align those requirements to the requirements of the 8(a) BD program.</p>
<p>The rule also adds a new § 125.8 to specify requirements for joint ventures between small business protégé firms and their mentors. The rule also makes several additional changes to current size, 8(a) BD and HUBZone regulations that are needed to clarify certain provisions or correct interpretations of the regulations that were inconsistent with SBA’s intent.</p>
</div>

<div id='app-comments-staff'>
<h2>Dedicated staff</h2>
<p>SBA recognizes that the D/GC is responsible for many other functions, and understands several commenters’ concerns that mentor-protégé applications might not be the highest priority of that office. Therefore, SBA intends to establish a separate unit within the Office of Business Development whose sole function would be to process mentor-protégé applications and review the MPAs and the assistance provided under them once approved. This final rule provides that this new unit will process and make determinations with respect to all small business MPAs, with the ultimate decision to be made by the AA/BD or his/her designee.</p>
</div>

<div id='junk'>
<p>These changes, the comments to the proposed rule, and SBA’s response to the comments are set forth more fully below.</p>
</div>

<div id='c-protege-eligibility-response-2'>
<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>However, SBA would not authorize mentor-protégé relationships in secondary NAICS codes where the firm had never performed any work in that NAICS code previously or where the protégé would bring nothing to a potential joint venture with its mentor other than its status as a small business. The intent of allowing joint ventures between a protégé firm and its mentor is to provide a protégé firm the opportunity to further develop its expertise and enhance its ability to independently perform similar contracts in the future. The mentor-protégé program is not intended to enable firms that have outgrown a particular size standard to find another industry in which they have no expertise or past performance merely to be able to continue to receive additional contracts as a small business. As long as the firm can demonstrate how the mentor-protégé relationship is a logical progression for the firm and will further develop current capabilities, SBA believes that a mentor-protégé relationship may be appropriate.</p>
</div>

<div id='disagree-unique'>
<h2>Unique problems</h2>
<p>HUBZone’s unique requirements with regard to employees, principal office, and residency make maintaining HUBZone status while participating in populated joint ventures difficult. In determining whether an individual should be determined an employee, the HUBZone program utilizes the totality of the circumstances approach and oftentimes a firm will have some individuals not on its payroll considered an employee for HUBZone eligibility purposes. Populated joint ventures present a problem because it can be difficult for firms to determine whom should be counted as an employee at any given time.</p>
</div>

<div id='app-comments-six'>
<h2>Senior SBA district directors</h2>
<p>SBA understands the concerns raised by the commenters. It is not SBA&#8217;s intent to delay participation in the small business mentor-protégé program. In order to reduce the processing time for a small business mentor-protégé application, SBA considered changing final approval from the D/GC to six senior SBA district directors. SBA thought that six decision makers instead of one might speed up the processing time for applications and eliminate the need for open enrollment periods. However, such a structure could also cause inconsistent results and could require more overall resources (by requiring additional staff in six different locations) than simply providing adequate staff at one location.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<div id='comments-mentor-finance'>
<h2>Good financial condition</h2>
<p>The proposed rule also required a firm seeking to be a mentor to demonstrate that it &#8220;possesses a good financial condition.&#8221; Several commenters urged SBA to clarify what it means to possess good financial condition. In addition, during the tribal consultations, several individuals spoke of situations where SBA denied a large multi-national firm from being a mentor because one or more financial documents indicated a loss. These individuals believed SBA did not take the proper approach when considering whether a business concern should be a mentor. They stressed that SBA should look only at whether the proposed mentor can deliver what it has said it will bring to the protégé . They believed that anything beyond that was not necessary.</p>

<div id='sbja-2010'>
<h2>Small Business Jobs Act of 2010</h2>
<p>On September 27, 2010, the President signed into law the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (<a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#sbja-2010','#jobs-act','Jobs Act')">Jobs Act</a>).</p>
<p>With the enactment of the Jobs Act, Congress recognized that mentor-protégé programs serve an important business development function for small business and authorized SBA to establish <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#sbja-2010','#disadvantaged','mentor-protégé programs')">mentor-protégé programs</a>, each modeled on SBA’s existing mentor-protégé program available to 8(a) Business Development (BD) Program Participants.</p>

<h2>Assistance</h2>
<p>The purpose of the assistance is to enhance the capabilities of protégé, to assist protégé with meeting their business goals, and to improve the ability of protégé to compete for contracts.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-proteges-4'>
<h2>Note 4</h2>
<p>These commenters believed that there would be no harm in allowing such a mentor-protégé relationship because the protégé firm would still have to qualify as a small business for any contract opportunity requiring status as a small business that it sought. In other words, if SBA approved a mentor-protégé relationship that focused on assisting a firm to gain access to or expand its experience in a particular industry or NAICS code where the proposed protégé firm qualified as a small business for the size standard corresponding to that NAICS code but not for the size standard corresponding to its primary industry, the protégé firm could form a joint venture with its mentor and be considered small for a contract opportunity only where the protégé firm qualified as small. It could not take that mentor-protégé relationship, form a joint venture and be considered small for contract opportunities in the protégé&#8217;s primary industry if the protégé did not qualify as small for that NAICS code.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-proteges-2'>
<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>These commenters supported consistency between the two programs and believed that allowing more mature small businesses to participate as protégés in the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program would facilitate more dynamic developmental assistance and strengthen the contractor base for government procurements. Several commenters also felt that the proposed change made the requirement clearer to understand and implement.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments-proteges-3'>
<h2>Note 3</h2>
<p>These commenters believed that the 8(a) mentor-protégé program should not be made available to larger, or successful, or experienced 8(a) Participants, and that allowing participation by firms that are close to exceeding their applicable size standard would thwart the purpose of the program.</p>
</div>

<div id='8a-change-concern'>
<h2>Note 5</h2>
<p>Specifically, commenters were concerned that SBA might want to eliminate the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program as a separate program and instead roll it into the small business mentor-protégé program.</p>

<div id='extended-cp'>
<h2>Extended</h2>
<p>Originally, comments were required to be made to SBA by April 6, 2015.</p>
<p>The overriding comment SBA received in the first few weeks after the publication was to extend the comment period.</p>

<div id='c-protege-multiple'>
<h2>One protégé may have up to two mentors</h2>
<p>The proposed rule provided that a protégé participating in either of the mentor-protégé programs generally would have no more than one mentor at a time. However, it authorized a protégé to have two mentors where the two relationships would not compete or otherwise conflict with each other and the protégé demonstrates that the second relationship pertains to an unrelated, secondary NAICS code, or the first mentor does not possess the specific expertise that is the subject of the MPA with the second mentor. The comments supported this provision and, therefore, SBA adopts it in this final rule.</p>
