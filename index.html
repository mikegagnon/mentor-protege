<h2>Details</h2>
<p>On January 2, 2013, the President signed into law the NDAA 2013, Public Law 112–239, 126 Stat. 1632.</p>
</div>

<div id='misc'>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>In addition, the rule makes several additional changes to current size, 8(a) Office of Hearings and Appeals and HUBZone regulations, concerning among other things, ownership and control, changes in primary industry, standards of review and interested party status for some appeals.</p>
</div>

<div id='one'>
<h2>One new small business mentor-protégé program</h2>
<p>This rule implements a mentor-protégé program similar to the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program for all small business concerns.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#125-9','1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA proposed one program for all small businesses,<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-easier','2')">2</a></sup> and requested comments on this proposal.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-comments','3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Most commenters supported this proposal.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#one-program-support','4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Many of the commenters were concerned, however, that changes could be made to the current 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#8a-change-concern','5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p>SBA has considered those concerns and has decided to keep the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program as a separate program.<sup><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#one','#8a-keep','6')">6</a></sup></p>
</div>

<div id='purpose-8a'>
<h2>Purpose of 8(a) BD</h2>
<p>The mentor-protégé program available to firms participating in the 8(a) BD program is used as a business development tool in which mentors provide diverse types of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#purpose-8a','#ba','business assistance')">business assistance</a> to eligible 8(a) BD protégés.</p>
<p>The explicit purpose of the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé relationship is to enhance the capabilities of protégés and to improve their ability to successfully compete for both government and commercial contracts.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mentor-protégé program for all small business concerns is designed to require approved mentors to provide <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#purpose-8a','#a','assistance')">assistance</a> to protégé firms.</p>
</div>

<div id='cancel-mpa'>
<h2>Cancel a MPA</h2>
<p>SBA’s analysis as to whether a protégé  firm is adequately benefiting from the relationship or whether non-compliance with one or more specific terms or conditions of the MPA should warrant termination of the agreement is a fact specific determination to be made based on the totality of the circumstances. SBA would not terminate a particular MPA where there are de minimus or inadvertent violations of the agreement.
In addition, it is not SBA’s intent to terminate a particular MPA without considering the views of the protégé firm. However, the mere fact that a protégé wants the mentor-protégé relationship to continue will not be dispositive if SBA believes that termination is justified.</p>
</div>

<div id='ndaa-2013'>
<h2>NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013</h2>
<p>Section 1641 of NDAA 2013 authorized SBA to establish a mentor-protégé program for all small business concerns.</p>
<p>This section further provides that a small business mentor-protégé program must be <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#ndaa-2013','#nearly','nearly')">nearly</a> identical to the 8(a) BD mentor-protégé program.</p>
<p>Section 1641 also <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#ndaa-2013','#limits-1641','limits')">limits</a> other agencies ability to create mentor-protégé programs.</p>
</div>

<div id='2010-name'>
<h2>2010 rule title</h2>
<p>The rule initially appeared in the Regulatory Agenda of Fall 2010 with the title &#8220;Small Business Jobs Act: Small Business Mentor-Protégé Programs.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div id='2013-name'>
<h2>2013 rule title</h2>
<p>SBA carried the 2010 rule title until the Regulatory Agenda of Spring 2013 when the reference to the Jobs Act was taken out, and the title changed to &#8220;Small Business Mentor-Protégé Programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This change reflected the statutory amendments in section 1641 of NDAA 2013.</p>
</div>

<div id='history-title'>
<h2>History of the rule title</h2>
<p>The title &#8220;Small Business Mentor Protégé Programs&#8221;
has evolved over a period of years.</p>

<div id='clarification'>
<h2>Clarification</h2>
<p>The rule also amends the current joint venture provisions to clarify the conditions for creating and operating joint venture partnerships, including the effect of such partnerships on any mentor-protégé relationships.</p>
</div>

<div id='title'>
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>Finally, SBA notes that the title of this rule has been changed.</p>
</div>

<div id='80-fr'>
<h2>80 FR 6618</h2>
<p>On February 5, 2015, SBA published in the Federal Register a comprehensive proposal to implement a new Government-wide mentor-protégé program for all small businesses, 80 FR 6618.</p>
<p>SBA decided to implement one new small business mentor-protégé program instead of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#80-fr','#four','four')">four</a> new mentor- protégé programs</p>
<p>SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#80-fr','#all-sb','did not eliminate')">did not eliminate</a> the 8(a) BD mentor- protégé program.</p>
<p>The small business mentor-protégé program was drafted to be as similar to the 8(a) mentor-protégé program as possible.</p>
</div>

<div id='comments'>
<h2>Comment period</h2>
<p>The proposed rule called for a 60-day comment period,
then SBA <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#extended-cp','extended')">extended</a> the comment period another 30 days.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a 90-day comment period, SBA also conducted a series of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#tribal','tribal consultations')">tribal consultations</a> pursuant to Executive Order 13175, Tribal Consultations.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments','#comments2','Comments')">Comments</a></p>
</div>

<div id='sba-disagree'>
<h2>SBA disagreed</h2>
<p>In the current 8(a) BD mentor-protégé  program, in order for any mentor-protégé  relationship to continue, the 8(a) protégé  firm must demonstrate annually what benefits it has derived from the mentor-protégé  relationship. Where the benefits provided to the protégé  firm are minimal or where it appears that the relationship has been used primarily to permit a non–8(a) (oftentimes, large) mentor to benefit from contracts with its approved protégé, through one or more joint ventures, that it would otherwise not be eligible for, SBA will terminate the mentor-protégé  relationship. The proposed rule also provided that SBA may terminate the mentor-protégé  agreement (MPA) where it determines that the parties are not complying with any term or condition of the MPA. This rule requires similar reporting of benefits for non–8(a) protégé  firms and similar consequences where the benefits provided to the protégé  firm do not adequately justify the mentor-protégé  relationship.</p>
</div>

<div id='opposed'>
<h2>Opposed</h2>
<p>The commenter believed that it has not been established that the 8(a) mentor-protégé  program is bestowing a substantial benefit on 8(a) Participants, and, therefore, SBA should perform additional research and analysis before expanding the program.</p>
</div>

<div id='one-program-easier'>
<h2>Note 2</h2>
<p>SBA proposed one program for all small businesses, because SBA believed it would be easier for the small business and acquisition communities to use and understand.</p>

</div>

<div id='supporting'>
<h2>Supporting</h2>
<p>These commenters believed that a small business mentor-protégé  program would enable firms that are not in the 8(a) BD program to receive critical business development assistance that would otherwise not be available to them. Many of these commenters expressed support for the opportunity to gain meaningful expertise that would help them to independently perform more complex and higher value contracts in the future.</p>
</div>

<div id='limits-1641'>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>Section 1641 provides that a Federal department or agency could not carry out its own agency specific mentor-protégé program for small businesses unless the head of the department or agency submitted a plan for such a program to SBA and received the SBA Administrator’s approval of the plan.</p>
<p>Finally, section 1641 requires the head of each Federal department or agency carrying out an agency-specific mentor-protégé program to report annually to SBA the participants in its mentor-protégé program, the assistance provided to small businesses through the program, and the progress of protégé firms to compete for Federal prime contracts and subcontracts.</p>
</div>

<div id='ba'>
<h2>Business assistance</h2>
<p>This assistance may include, among other things, technical and/or management assistance; financial assistance in the form of equity investments and/or loans; subcontracts; and/or assistance in performing Federal prime contracts through joint venture arrangements.</p>

<div id='comments2'>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>One commenter <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments2','#opposed','opposed')">opposed</a> expanding the mentor-protégé  program beyond the 8(a) BD program,

<p>One commenter requested clarification as to when and how SBA would <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments2','#cancel-mpa','cancel a MPA')">cancel a MPA</a> (mentor protégé agreement).</p>
<p>Conversely, SBA received a significant number of comments <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#comments2','#supporting','supporting')">supporting</a> a small business mentor-protégé  program.</p>

<p>With the enactment of the Jobs Act, Congress recognized that mentor-protégé programs serve an important business development function for small business and authorized SBA to establish <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#sbja-2010','#disadvantaged','mentor-protégé programs')">mentor-protégé programs</a>, each modeled on SBA’s existing mentor-protégé program available to 8(a) Business Development (BD) Program Participants.</p>
<p>See section 1347(b)(3) of the Jobs Act.</p>
</div>

<div id='one-program-support'>
<h2>Note 4</h2>
<p>Most commenters supported having one new small business mentor-protégé program instead of four new mentor-protégé programs (one for SDVO small businesses, one for HUBZone small businesses, one for WOSBs, and one for small businesses not falling into one of the other categories).</p>
<p>Commenters agreed that it would be less confusing to deal with one new program, rather than four new programs, and that it was not necessary to have four separate mentor-protégé programs since the three subcategories of small business are necessarily included within the overall category of small business.</p>
</div>

<div id='a'>
<h2>Assistance</h2>
<p>The purpose of the assistance is to enhance the capabilities of protégés, to assist protégés with meeting their business goals, and to improve the ability of protégés to compete for contracts.</p>

<h2>Four</h2>
<ol>
<li>One for small businesses</li>
<li>One for SDVO small businesses</li>
<li>One for WOSBs</li>
<li>One for HUBZone small businesses</li>
</ol>
<p>SBA made the decision to create one program since the other three types of small businesses (SDVO, HUBZone and women-owned) would be necessarily included within any mentor-protégé program targeting all small business concerns.</p>

<div id='final-name'>
<h2>Final rule title</h2>
<p>In drafting the final rule, SBA concluded that the simpler current title (&#8220;Small Business Mentor Protégé Programs&#8221;) is easier for the public to understand and would be consistent with the title that has been publicly reported in the Regulatory Agenda since 2013.</p>

<p>The amendment was based on authorities provided in these two statutes.</p>
</div>

<div id='8a-keep'>
<h2>Note 6</h2>
<p>The 8(a) BD program has independently operated successfully for a number of years and SBA believes that it serves important business development purposes that should continue to be coordinated through SBA’s Office of Business Development, rather than through a separate mentor-protégé office managed elsewhere within the Agency.
